      "favorited": false,
      "ingredients": "For The Crust: 2 cups (200 g) graham cracker crumbs, about 2 sleeves, ¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar, 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted. For The Filling: 32 ounces (904 g) cream cheese, room temperature, 1 ⅓ cups (266 g) granulated sugar, 1 cup (227 g) sour cream, room temperature, 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, ¼ teaspoon salt, 4 large eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten. For The Sauce: 16 ounces (400 g) whole strawberries, diced. 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, ⅛ teaspoon salt, 2 cups (334 g) finely chopped strawberries",
      "recipe": "Make The Crust-  Move the oven rack to the lower third position and heat the oven to 350°F. Wrap the outer bottom of a 9-inch springform pan tightly with aluminum foil. Combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and about 2-inches up the sides of the pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool while you make the filling. Make The Filling - Reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF. In a large mixing bowl beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and sour cream, beat until well combined. Add the vanilla and salt, beat on low speed until smooth. Using a silicone spatula, gently stir in the eggs just until combined. Pour the batter over the prepared crust. Fill a roasting pan with a few inches of boiling water and place the cheesecake in the center. Bake for 1 hour, OR until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly. Turn the oven off, leave the cheesecake in the water bath in the oven for another hour. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and place it on a wire rack. Run a small knife around the outer edge of the cheesecake to loosen it from the pan and leave it to cool at room temperature for about 1 ½ hours. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Alternatively, you can refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight after it has cooled and make the sauce about 1 hour before serving. Top the chilled cheesecake with the sauce or top individual slices when ready to serve. Make The Sauce: Add the diced strawberries and cornstarch to the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a medium saucepan and add the sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, salt, and chopped strawberries. Set aside to cool for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spread the topping evenly over the cheesecake and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Remove the sides of the pan just before serving.",

      "recipe": " In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, almond flour, baking soda and salt until evenly combined. Set aside.  Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter is melted start to whisk constantly. First the butter will begin to foam, then after a couple of minutes it will begin to brown on the bottom of the saucepan. Turn off the heat as soon as the solids turn brown and the butter gives off a nutty aroma. Pour into a glass mixing bowl to prevent burning. Add the milk, brown sugar and white sugar. Whisk to combine. Add the egg and vanilla and whisk until smooth and creamy. Using a rubber spatula, mix in the dry ingredients until well combined. Stir in the chocolate chips. Cover the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350F. Scoop the cookie dough (about 2 Tablespoons of dough per cookie) and place a few inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until golden and the center is set. Let cool 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling. Enjoy!",

      "recipe": "Preheat the oven to 325°F. Arrange six 4-ounce ramekins in a 2-inch deep baking dish. Set aside. Add milk, cream, and vanilla bean paste to a medium saucepan and heat over medium-high heat until bubbles appear along the sides of the pan. In a medium bowl, quickly whisk the sugar and egg yolks together. Slowly pour the hot cream into the yolk mixture while whisking continuously until well combined. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher or large liquid measuring cup. Pour the custard into the ramekins. Place the baking pan with filled ramekins inside the oven. Then, carefully fill the pan with enough hot water to come ⅔ of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake 25-30 minutes, just until set. Start checking the custard early. Bake time will vary depending on the thickness and depth of your ramekins. The custard should be set and not soupy with only a small area of jiggle in the center. Carefully remove the baking dish from the oven and allow the ramekins to cool in the water bath. Once the ramekins are cool enough to handle, remove them from the water, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 2 days before serving. Just before serving, sprinkle the tops of the custard with an even layer of granulated sugar, then immediately caramelize the sugar with a propane torch or broiler.",

Slowly pour milk mixture into eggs while whisking at a low speed to temper. Do not mix too fast or it will froth and foam. Blend until mixed. Transfer back to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat for 3-5 minutes or until thickened. Whisk continually to prevent mixture from scalding to the pan. As soon as mixture thickens, remove from heat and whisk in butter. Transfer to a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Press plastic wrap into the custard mixture so there is no air between the two. This prevents the filmy skin that can develop. To set faster, place in small ramekins or bowls.
